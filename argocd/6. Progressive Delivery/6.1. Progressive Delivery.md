Progressive Delivery is an approach to software delivery that enables teams to release new features and updates to production gradually, and to monitor and validate the impact of those changes on users and the system as a whole. Progressive Delivery is a key part of the DevOps and Continuous Delivery philosophy, and is supported by tools and frameworks like ArgoCD and Istio.

The goal of Progressive Delivery is to reduce the risk and impact of software releases by introducing new features and changes gradually, and to validate the results of those changes in real-time. Progressive Delivery typically involves a series of stages, or gates, that the application must pass through before it can be fully deployed to production. These stages may include:

- Canary release: A small subset of users or traffic is routed to the new version of the application, while the majority of traffic continues to use the current version. This allows teams to validate the new version in a controlled environment, and to identify any issues or performance problems before rolling out the changes to the entire user base.

- Blue-green deployment: The new version of the application is deployed alongside the current version, and traffic is gradually shifted from the old version to the new version. This allows teams to test the new version in production, while minimizing the impact on users and the system as a whole.

- A/B testing: Multiple versions of the application are deployed simultaneously, and different versions are presented to different users or traffic segments. This allows teams to test different variations of the application and to measure the impact of those changes on user engagement, conversion rates, or other metrics.

- Rollback and remediation: If any issues or problems are detected during the Progressive Delivery process, teams can quickly roll back the changes to a previous version, and to remediate any issues or bugs before attempting to deploy the changes again.

By using Progressive Delivery, teams can reduce the risk and impact of software releases, while still delivering new features and updates to users in a timely and efficient manner. Progressive Delivery can also help teams to gain visibility into the impact of their changes on the system and on users, and to iterate and improve their software delivery processes over time.
