Argo Rollouts is a Kubernetes controller that enables teams to perform advanced deployment strategies, such as canary deployments, blue-green deployments, and feature flag rollouts, in a controlled and automated manner. Argo Rollouts builds on the Kubernetes Deployment and Service resources, and provides additional functionality for managing traffic routing, versioning, and scaling.

Argo Rollouts allows teams to define custom rollout strategies for their applications, based on metrics and conditions, and to automate the deployment and scaling of their applications in a progressive and safe manner. Some of the key features of Argo Rollouts include:

- Canary deployments: Argo Rollouts allows teams to perform canary deployments, where a small percentage of traffic is routed to a new version of the application, while the majority of traffic continues to use the current version. Argo Rollouts provides tools for monitoring the health and performance of the new version, and for automatically promoting or rolling back the changes based on predefined metrics or conditions.

- Blue-green deployments: Argo Rollouts allows teams to perform blue-green deployments, where a new version of the application is deployed alongside the current version, and traffic is gradually shifted from the old version to the new version. Argo Rollouts provides tools for monitoring the progress of the rollout, and for automatically promoting or rolling back the changes based on predefined metrics or conditions.

- Feature flag rollouts: Argo Rollouts allows teams to perform feature flag rollouts, where new features or changes are gradually enabled or disabled for specific users or traffic segments. Argo Rollouts provides tools for defining custom rollout strategies based on metrics, and for automatically promoting or rolling back the changes based on the results of A/B testing or other validation methods.

- Custom metrics and conditions: Argo Rollouts allows teams to define custom metrics and conditions for their rollout strategies, based on application-level or infrastructure-level metrics, such as response time, error rate, or resource usage. Argo Rollouts provides tools for monitoring these metrics, and for automatically promoting or rolling back the changes based on the results of the monitoring.

By using Argo Rollouts, teams can perform advanced deployment strategies in a safe and automated manner, and can reduce the risk and impact of software releases on users and the system as a whole. Argo Rollouts integrates with ArgoCD, and can be used in conjunction with other Kubernetes tools and frameworks to build a robust and scalable deployment pipeline for modern cloud-native applications.
