In ArgoCD, an application represents a Kubernetes application that is being managed by ArgoCD. It consists of a set of Kubernetes resources, such as deployments, services, and config maps, that are defined in a Git repository and deployed to a target Kubernetes cluster. ArgoCD continuously monitors the state of the application and ensures that it stays in sync with the desired state specified in the Git repository.

An application can be created in ArgoCD using the argocd app create command, which specifies the Git repository and Kubernetes cluster to which the application should be deployed, as well as other application-specific settings such as the sync policy, the application name, and the namespace.

An application set, on the other hand, is a higher-level construct that allows you to manage a group of related applications as a single entity. An application set defines a set of applications that share a common set of parameters, such as the namespace, the Git repository URL, and the branch or tag to use.

When you create an application set, ArgoCD generates multiple instances of the application, one for each value in the set of parameters. This allows you to manage many similar applications with a single definition, and simplifies the process of creating and updating multiple applications that share common configuration.

Application sets are defined using the ApplicationSet custom resource definition (CRD) in Kubernetes, which allows you to define the set of parameters and the desired state of each application instance. The ApplicationSet CRD is provided by the ArgoCD ApplicationSet controller, which manages the lifecycle of the application instances and ensures that they remain in sync with the desired state.

Overall, applications and application sets are powerful constructs in ArgoCD that allow you to manage Kubernetes applications with greater efficiency and consistency.
