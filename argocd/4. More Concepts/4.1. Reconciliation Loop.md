The reconciliation loop is a core concept in ArgoCD and Kubernetes. It refers to the continuous process by which the desired state of a Kubernetes cluster is compared to its actual state, and any differences between the two states are automatically corrected.

In ArgoCD, the reconciliation loop is driven by a controller that runs within the ArgoCD server. The controller is responsible for monitoring the Git repositories and Kubernetes clusters associated with each ArgoCD application, and ensuring that the desired state of the applications is continuously propagated to the target clusters.

The controller initiates the reconciliation process periodically, based on a default interval of five minutes. During each reconciliation cycle, the controller performs the following steps:

- Polls the Git repositories associated with each application to check for changes.
- If changes are detected in a repository, the controller updates the internal state of the corresponding ArgoCD application to reflect the changes.
- Compares the desired state of the application, as specified in the Git repository, to the actual state of the target Kubernetes cluster.
- If there are discrepancies between the desired and actual states, the controller generates Kubernetes manifests to reconcile the differences.
- Applies the generated manifests to the target cluster using the Kubernetes API, which brings the cluster back into the desired state.
- Continues to monitor the state of the target cluster and to reconcile any further discrepancies that arise.

By automating the reconciliation process, ArgoCD allows developers and operations teams to focus on creating and deploying applications, rather than manually managing the state of the underlying infrastructure. The default five-minute interval ensures that any changes made to the Git repository are propagated to the target cluster quickly, while also reducing the load on the Kubernetes API server. However, this interval can be adjusted as needed to meet the specific needs of each ArgoCD deployment.
