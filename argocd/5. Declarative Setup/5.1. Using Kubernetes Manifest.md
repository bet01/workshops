In ArgoCD, the declarative approach for defining an application involves specifying the desired state of the application in a declarative configuration file, typically in YAML format. This file describes the desired state of the Kubernetes resources that make up the application, as well as any additional configuration parameters, such as the sync policy, the namespace, and the target cluster.

The declarative configuration file can be stored in a Git repository, along with the application code and other deployment artifacts, and can be versioned and managed just like any other code artifact. When changes are made to the configuration file, ArgoCD automatically detects the changes and synchronizes the application state with the desired state specified in the file.

Here is an example of a declarative configuration file for a simple Kubernetes deployment:

```yaml
apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
kind: Application
metadata:
  name: demo
  # You'll usually want to add your resources to the argocd namespace.
  namespace: argocd
  # Add a this finalizer ONLY if you want these to cascade delete.
  finalizers:
    - resources-finalizer.argocd.argoproj.io
spec:
  # The project the application belongs to.
  project: default

  # Source of the application manifests
  source:
    repoURL: https://github.com/bet01/workshops.git
    targetRevision: HEAD
    path: ./argocd/declarative/manifests
   
    # directory
    directory:
      recurse: false
  # Destination cluster and namespace to deploy the application
  destination:
    server: https://kubernetes.default.svc
    namespace: default

  # Sync policy
  syncPolicy:
    automated: # automated sync by default retries failed attempts 5 times with following delays between attempts ( 5s, 10s, 20s, 40s, 80s ); retry controlled using `retry` field.
      prune: true # Specifies if resources should be pruned during auto-syncing ( false by default ).
      selfHeal: true # Specifies if partial app sync should be executed when resources are changed only in target Kubernetes cluster and no git change detected ( false by default ).
      allowEmpty: false # Allows deleting all application resources during automatic syncing ( false by default ).

```

By defining the desired state of the application in a declarative configuration file, you can ensure that the application is deployed in a consistent and repeatable manner, and that any changes to the application are automatically detected and synchronized with the target Kubernetes cluster. This can help reduce errors, improve reliability, and increase the efficiency of your Kubernetes deployments.

To apply the declarative configuration file for an ArgoCD application using kubectl, you can use the following steps:

- Save the YAML configuration file to a file on your local machine, for example, application.yaml.
- Open a command prompt or terminal and navigate to the directory where the YAML file is located.
- Log in to the Kubernetes cluster where you want to deploy the application using the kubectl command:

```powershell
kubectl apply -f application.yaml
```

- Verify that the application has been deployed successfully by running the following command:

```powershell
kubectl get applications
```
