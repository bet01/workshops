The App-of-Apps pattern is a design pattern in ArgoCD that allows you to manage multiple related applications using a single top-level application, called the "app of apps". The App-of-Apps pattern is used when you have multiple applications that share common configuration settings, such as the target cluster, the namespace, or the Git repository URL.

In the App-of-Apps pattern, the top-level application defines the desired state of the entire set of related applications, and manages the deployment and synchronization of each application instance. The top-level application can be thought of as a meta-application, which is responsible for orchestrating the deployment of the underlying applications.

Here's an example of how the App-of-Apps pattern might be used in a multi-application deployment:

- Define a top-level application: The top-level application specifies the desired state of the entire set of related applications, including the list of applications to be deployed, their Git repository URLs, and their target Kubernetes clusters and namespaces.

- Define child applications: Each child application corresponds to a single Kubernetes application that needs to be deployed. Each child application is defined using a separate YAML file that specifies the desired state of the application.

- Link child applications to top-level application: The child applications are linked to the top-level application using the argocd app create command, which specifies the Git repository URL and the path to the YAML file for each child application.

- Deploy the top-level application: The top-level application is deployed using the same argocd app create command, which specifies the desired state of the entire set of related applications, including the list of child applications and their configuration.

- Monitor the deployment status: The status of the top-level application and its child applications can be monitored using the argocd app list command, which displays the current state of each application.

By using the App-of-Apps pattern in ArgoCD, you can manage multiple related applications as a single entity, which simplifies the process of deployment and synchronization, reduces the likelihood of errors, and provides greater visibility into the status of the entire deployment.
