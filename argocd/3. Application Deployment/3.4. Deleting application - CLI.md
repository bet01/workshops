To delete an application using the ArgoCD CLI, you can use the argocd app delete command. Here are the steps:

**Log in to the ArgoCD Server using the CLI**

Open a command prompt or terminal and enter the following command:

```powershell
argocd login localhost:8080 --insecure --username admin --password <initial-admin-password>
```

Replace <initial-admin-password> with the initial admin password obtained earlier.

This command will log you in to the ArgoCD server using the CLI.

**Delete the Application**

To delete an application, use the following command:

### [Windows](#tab/powershell)

```powershell
argocd app delete <application-name>
```

### [Mac](#tab/bash)

```bash
argocd app delete <application-name>
```

Replace <application-name> with the name of the application that you want to delete.

This command will delete the specified application and remove all resources associated with it from the target Kubernetes cluster.
