**Deploying a Simple Application with ArgoCD**

In this example, we'll be deploying a simple application from a Git repository using the ArgoCD web UI. Here are the steps:

**Install and Access ArgoCD**

Before you can deploy the application, you need to have ArgoCD installed and running. You can follow the steps in the previous sections to install and access ArgoCD using the command line or Docker Desktop with Kubernetes.

**Create a New Application**

Once you have access to the ArgoCD web UI, you can create a new application by following these steps:

- Click on the "New App" button in the top-left corner of the UI.
- In the "General" tab, enter a name for your application (e.g. "simple-app").
- In the "Project" tab, select the project where you want to deploy the application.
- In the "Sync Policy" tab, select "Automatic" to enable continuous deployment.
- In the "Source" tab, enter the Git URL for the simple-app repository (https://github.com/bet01/workshops).
- In the "Path" field, enter the path to the simple-app directory (e.g. "./argocd/simple-app")
- In the "Destination" tab, select the target Kubernetes cluster and namespace where you want to deploy the application.
- For namespace, select the *default* namespace.
- Click the "Create" button to create the new application.

Step 3: Monitor the Application Deployment

Once you've created the application, ArgoCD will automatically deploy the application and show you the status of the deployment in the ArgoCD web UI.

You can monitor the deployment status by clicking on the name of the application in the ArgoCD UI. This will show you the current status of the application deployment, including any errors or warnings.
